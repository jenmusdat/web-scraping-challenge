# Web-Scraping-Challenge

This assignment asked that we scrape information from the Nasa site regarding Mars and then feed into a Mongo Database to finally render it into an HTML file of our own. In combining so many different types of work together the assignment proved to be very challenging.

In order to run this assignment you need to use:

- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- flask
- flask-PyMongo
- splinter
- beautuiful soup
- you need to make sure you download chromedriver.eve

The final html looked like:
